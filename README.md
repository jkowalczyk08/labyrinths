# Labyrinths
In Sandbox mode, you can select a maze from presets, from a file, or build your own. You can modify it or generate a random maze using buttons in the Modify section. Then choose an algorithm and see how it finds the optimal path from start to finish. If you want to use this maze later, click Save. In Adventure mode, you can find the path on your own using WASD keys.

This is an IntelliJ IDEA project. You can run it in IntelliJ IDEA, you only need JavaFX https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/javafx.html#run.
